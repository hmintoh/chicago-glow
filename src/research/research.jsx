                Fama does not believe that markets are efficient always. Our

                on over 50 years of data across over 20 countries to take

                Individual investors tend to chase returns and overreact to
                short-term news. We exploit these short-term errors in the
                market while striving to reduce behavioral biases among our own
                investors through the application of Richard Thalerâ€™s principles
                using nudges and sludges.
